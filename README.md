# Screen-Tearing-Fix-X11
Fixes screen tearing for X11.
Really basic, basically for practical use when i install xorg on a new PC/laptop.
Install with 
```curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PetrifiedOak/Screen-Tearing-Fix-X11/main/screentearing | sh```
Not adding this to .local/bin or /usr/bin because you only have to run it once.
